In the first data frame, "district_summary," we can interpret that students perform better in reading than in Mathematics.

According to the "Per School Summary" spreadsheet, we can subtract the following information:
Charter schools perform better than district schools. We can infer this information when we analyze the best and worst performances of schools. In other words, charter schools are in the top 5 best-performing schools, and the top 5 worst-performing schools are district schools. The spreadsheet type_summary expresses this point more deeply. 

Schools with the highest per capita budget per student occupy the ranks of schools with the lowest performance. Therefore, increasing school budgets will not necessarily improve student performance. The spending_summary spreadsheet clearly shows this data.

According to the data analyzed, small and medium-sized schools perform better than large schools, as shown in the size_summary spreadsheet.
